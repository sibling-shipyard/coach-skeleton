"""Resolve "today" in the athlete's own timezone instead of the host machine's clock.

Issue #45: the retired quest-log generator and generate_quest_history.py used bare date.today() -
correct on a developer's laptop, wrong on a GitHub Actions runner (UTC),
which can disagree with the athlete's own wall-clock day by several hours right at the
UTC rollover. current_week.json's `timezone` field is a required, schema-validated field
(engine/lib/current-week.mts's REQUIRED_FIELDS + validateTimeZone) - already the same
source of truth the dashboard and Coach's own boot sequence use.

Depends on the host having IANA tz data available for zoneinfo.ZoneInfo to resolve names
against - true by default on the sync workflow's ubuntu-latest runner (system tzdata at
/usr/share/zoneinfo), but would need the `tzdata` PyPI package if this ever runs on a
minimal/Alpine-based image instead.
