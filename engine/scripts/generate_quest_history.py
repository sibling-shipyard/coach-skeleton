"""Generate quest_history.json from all season archives.

Reads seasons/*/challenge_v2.json (sorted by start_date) then
ledger/challenge_v2.json (current season). For each daily_streak quest,
reconstructs per-day status from polarity + date arrays and writes a unified
flat file the dashboard can read without being season-aware.

Output path:
  - QUEST_HISTORY_OUTPUT env var if set
  - gen/quest_history.json (new layout) or training/activities/quest_history.json (legacy)

Status values: "done", "missed", "excused"
Gaps (e.g., Jun 7-17 between seasons) are omitted — no entry means no data.

Each quest also carries start_date (earliest seen across every season) and end_date (null while
still active - i.e. present in the current/live season - otherwise the date it was last
processed through) so a consumer can tell a still-open quest from a retired one without scanning
entries.

Usage:

    A quest tracked continuously across a season transition (same id, same start_date carried
    forward rather than reset) means the just-archived season and the new live season can cover
    an overlapping date range - the transition renames the season/phase without giving the quest
    a fresh start_date. quests_out[qid]["entries"] is keyed by date (not a plain list) during
    processing specifically to absorb that overlap: a later-processed season's status for a date
    wins over an earlier one's (archives are processed in start_date order, current season last,
    so "later" here means "more current" - the live season's status for a shared date is more
    likely to reflect any post-hoc correction than the frozen archive's).
